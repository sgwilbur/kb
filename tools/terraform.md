# Terraform

First getting some conceptual knowledge around Terraform.

*Welcome to the intro guide to Terraform! This guide is the best place to start with Terraform. We cover what Terraform is, what problems it can solve, how it compares to existing software, and contains a quick start for using Terraform.* - [Introduction - Terraform by HashiCorp](https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html)

Once you have a handle on the concepts you can try and tie them together for a simple project that you can execute.

*Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools allow you to manage infrastructure with configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.* - [Introduction to Infrastructure as Code with Terraform | Terraform - HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/infrastructure-as-code)
