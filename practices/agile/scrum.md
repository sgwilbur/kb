# Scrum

    Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

    Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. Scrum co-creators Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland have written The Scrum Guide to explain Scrum clearly and succinctly.  This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrumâ€™s accountabilities, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. 

    In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:

    A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
    The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.
    The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
