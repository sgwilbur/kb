# Workflow Automation

This is a broad category that will span multiple areas, domains, and tools. The core take away is to ensure that a thoughtful approach is taken to making workflow the core focus.

The workflow should be designed to capture intent of scenario not to fit the tool that you happen to have available. A common area for sub-optimzation is to map an existing bad process onto a new tool, the results are mediocre and the return on investment is not there. A better option is to focus first on how you can use the existing tools or in place tools to standardize on approaches and usage models.
