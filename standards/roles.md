# Roles

Understand that each scenario, use case, and workflow will be specific to a class or user or "role." The use of roles early helps to lower the complexity of documenting and elaborating scenarios to specific roles.

Having a role abstraction allows for shared context to me managed by the specific role while the scenario in question can focus on the task at hand.
